# Native code (C++) Voxel Plugin for Unity

This plugin generates a Voxel Based Terrain using adaptive Octrees and Manifold Dual Contouring for isosurface extraction. It is a port of my previous project UnderWorld and altered to be usable in Unity.

This is a fork of the following Unity Rendering Plugin example
[native plugin interface](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePluginInterface.html).

Unity versions:

* **2018.1** use tip of default branch.
* 5.4, 5.5, 4.6: use corresponding `unity-x.x` tag.
* Earlier versions: may or might not work, not tested.
